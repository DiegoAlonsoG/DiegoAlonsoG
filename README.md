<h1 align="center">Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome, I'm Diego Alonso Gutierrez</h1>

<h2 align="center">Full Stack Developer</h2>

Who am I?<br/>
I'm a Full Stack Developer with a focus in BackEnd. I like to develop projects having its scale and growth projection into account.

Why me?<br/>
I have a well developed abstract thinking capability, which allows me to extrapolate situations and find a creative way of solving the task at hand. Also, i'm very curious and sociable, which in turn allows me learn constantly by myself and from peers and colegues.

Job history:<br/>
My background is in Finances and Supply Chain. I have worked on those for many years now. I decided to switch careers to Tech because of the lack of available digital tools in the market. Lastly, i've always been comfortable in corporate environments where the company's culture is inclusive and based on mutual respect.
